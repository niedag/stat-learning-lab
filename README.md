To have a Python script execute when you launch Jupyter Notebook for an entire directory, you can use a Jupyter Notebook configuration file (jupyter_notebook_config.py). This file allows you to customize various aspects of Jupyter Notebook, including executing Python code when starting a notebook server.

Generate a config file with ```jupyter notebook --generate-config```
For Ubuntu, this file is located at ~/.jupyter/
